 On May 8th maintenance visits were made to the Gilbert point and Haenke Island monitoring systems. Team members included individuals from CRREL, the New England District COE, the Alaska District COE office in Anchorage and National Geographic. At Gilbert Pt. programming modifications were made to the ranging system to allow for increased data measurements and other necessary refinements. At the Haenke Island Climate site, solar radiation and barometric pressure sensors were added. Additional solar panels were added to both locations. The system is currently functioning and data are flowing from the field to the database as hoped. DCF
