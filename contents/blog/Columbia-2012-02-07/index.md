In the Fall of 2011, researchers from the USGS (Dr. Shad ONeel) and CRREL worked to deploy a realtime Iridium web camera at Columbia Glacier. The camera is focused on the central terminus of Columbia Glacier and captures up to 4 images per day in optimal lighting conditions. The camera operated succesfully until late November when it suffered a power failure. We are currently working on a schedule to make repairs to the camera.
