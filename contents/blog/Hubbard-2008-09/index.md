 A group of researchers from CRREL and the US Army COE New England District visited the monitoring sites at Gilbert Point and Haenke Island to service all monitoring equipment and download high-resolution imagery collected hourly over the summer. All equipment at both locations was in top working order and no major repairs were needed at this time. The sites are showing signs of wear and next Spring some repairs to the towers and cables will be made to make sure no major problems incur.
