 Installation of the terminus monitoring system at Gilbert point and the climate monitoring site/radio repeater station at Haenke Island. Installation team consisted of CRREL, New England District and Alaska District COE team members. Installation at each site was successful but due to radio equipment failures in the field. Terminus data acquired failed to relay to the satellite system for transmission to the database. At this time only climate data from Haenke Island is available via the web. A tentative trip is scheduled for November to remediate the problem prior to winter.
