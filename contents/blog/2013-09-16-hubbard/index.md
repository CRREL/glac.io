### Gilbert Point 

The Automated Laser ranging system at Gilbert Point was replaced in late August with a new updated system.
Researchers from CRREL, The National Snow and Ice Data Center (Boulder, Colorado) and the USGS Alaska Science Center (Anchorage) removed the previous laser scanning system and replaced it with an updated version of the system developed by CRREL.
The previous system was dependent on a high-powered radio link to Haenke Island, which required significant power to operate.
The new system utilizes a low-power two-way Iridium communication system that reduces overall power consumption and allows for increased data acquisition intervals (hourly).
Furthermore, a realtime camera system has been installed at Gilbert Point to collect and transmit visible images every 3 hours and thermal images every 8 hours.

### Haenke Island

The climate station at Haenke Island is damaged beyond repair and is scheduled for replacement.
Inclement weather prohibited the team from replacing the system in August but the team will return in November to bring a new modern station online.
The new system will also operate on the Iridium network versus the previous GOES system.
