Our colleagues at the USGS Alaska successfully replaced the old time-lapse camera installed at Columbia Glacier this week with our latest designed system. Capturing and transmitting images every 3-hours during daylight, this camera will help to track the movement of Columbia Glacier, which has been in accelerated retreat since the early 1980's. Near real-time images can be viewed on the **[Columbia Glacier Real-time Images](\locations/columbia/realtime-images.html)** page.
