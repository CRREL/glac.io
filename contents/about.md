The mission and philosophy of Glacier Research is to provide a perspective into ongoing glacier and glacier related climate studies worldwide. 

Glacier related science requires a multidisciplinary approach that integrates field-based scientific measurements with technological advancements. A field that is constantly evolving to incorporate new monitoring techniques like time-lapse cameras, thermal image capture, LiDAR surveys, satellite communications and geophysical techniques. 

This website and the pages within are the culmination of numerous scientific organizations, academic institutions, government agencies and individuals with a common cause; seeking to provide a glimpse of glacier and research related activities to the public and greater scientific communities.
